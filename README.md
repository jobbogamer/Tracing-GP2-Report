# Tracing and Debugging in GP 2

I did an MEng degree at the University of York from 2012â€“2017. For my final year project in 2016/17, I added tracing features to GP 2, a graph programming language developed at York. This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the report I submitted for the project.
